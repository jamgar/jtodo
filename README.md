# JTODO

It is a To Do app that I created with Rails 5. I deployed it to Heroku 
[here](https://safe-castle-14864.herokuapp.com/ "JTodo"). The app allows
you to signup/login using Devise, create a task that is defaulted to 
"To Do" state and then lets you move to "Doing" and "Done". I created as
test so I could add it to my website to have a place to track my tasks.
